# SRE-Bootcamp

This is a REST API server for CRUD operations on Students. The repo is used as the main service in One2N's [SRE Bootcamp](https://playbook.one2n.in/sre-bootcamp/sre-bootcamp-exercises)

### Local Setup

Use `make` to view all the available commands

```bash
‚ùØ make
Usage: make <target>
Targets:
  help                           Display help
  dc-up                          dc-up starts the dependencies in the background
  dc-down                        dc-down stops the running dependencies
  build                          build builds the server binary
  build-app                      build-app builds the app docker image
  run                            run starts the server
  run-app                        run-app starts the app container on port 9090
  test                           test runs the tests
  check-lint                     check-lint checks whether golangci-lint is installed
  lint                           lint runs the linter
  build-migration                build-migration builds the migration binary
  migrate                        migrate runs the up migration
  migrate-down                   migrate-down runs the down migration. You can optionally pass the number of steps to rollback like: make migrate-down steps=1
  force-migrate                  force-migrate force migrates a schema version. It requires a version to be passed like: make force-migrate version=1
  docker-build-migration         docker-build-migration builds the migration docker image
  docker-migrate                 docker-migrate runs the migration docker container
```

- Clone the repo.
  
- `make dc-up` sets up the local dependencies. Make sure docker is installed on your system.

- Create a `.env` file in the root of this repo and copy all the keys from `.env.default`. Add suitable values for your environment.

- Once the dependencies are up and running, run the database migration using `make migrate`. Check `make help` for more info on force migration and rollback.

- Use `make run` to run the API server.

- Import the `Student API.postman_collection.json` file in Postman to use the APIs.


### Local Docker Setup

- Clone the repo.
  
- `make dc-up` sets up the local dependencies. Make sure docker is installed on your system.
  
- Create a `dockerapp.env` file in the root of this repo and copy all the keys from `.env.default`. Add suitable values for your environment.
  - Note : Use `host.docker.internal` instead of `localhost` for hostname in the dependencies.

- Once the dependencies are up and running, run the database migration using `make docker-migrate`.

- Use `make run-app` to start the API server in a container.

- Import the `Student API.postman_collection.json` file in Postman to use the APIs.
